# assignment-4

This project has been by far the worst for me. I had the inital code form the demo and tried to copy it over into a new porject to then make my own chnges to it. When i did this I and tried to make the changes i wanted I confused myself and couldn't work out where the issues were. I then unfortunately didn't have the time to start the project form scratch and try to build the site myself which is why I am left with the same code as the demo. Unfortunately I really didn't enjoy or undertand this past week or project
I am also unsure as to what happened with render as i did all of the stpes but it still continues to say 'building'
